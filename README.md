# Book Club Project

This repository organizes materials for two product-focused book clubs aimed at helping IT professionals think beyond code to product and business strategy.

## The Book Clubs

### Virtual Book Club
A monthly book club for IT professionals at work. Meetings are virtual, approximately one hour, focused on discussing the current book.

### Physical Book Club (Local)
A local in-person book club. Flyers will be posted at engineering buildings to recruit members. Same reading track as the virtual club.

## Why This Exists
Reading product-focused books helps raise awareness above day-to-day coding tasks to think more about the product, the business, and how to work effectively with product managers. This book club creates space to discuss these ideas with others on the same journey.

## Reading List
See [books/reading-list.md](books/reading-list.md) for the full itinerary.

**Starting with:**
1. Escaping the Build Trap - Melissa Perri
2. The Art of Action - Stephen Bungay
3. Amp It Up - Frank Slootman
